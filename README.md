This is a scraper for "wonderkids" for the Football Manager 2018 game using Scrapy.

The data comes from this website: https://www.fmscout.com/a-football-manager-2018-wonderkids.html

The spiders get the data from the tables and outputs a CSV file for each table with their respective data.

A virtual environment was used for this and the necessary dependencies are in the requirements.txt

NOTE: Scrapy kinda hard to install through pip. Had to manually download Twisted 18.7.0 and then install that through pip for it to work.
